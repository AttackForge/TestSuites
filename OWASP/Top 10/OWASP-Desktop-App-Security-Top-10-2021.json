In general Desktop apps widely use 2 or 3 Tier architecture, so depending upon the sink, it would be impacted. Desktop apps may use XML to save configuration/data hence all kinds of XML injections would apply. They also quite often use databases like MySQL/MSSQL/etc., so they are equally vulnerable to SQL injections. Many Desktop apps provide functionality which may use system calls in background, leaving wide exposure to OS command injection. Sometimes desktop apps are made to render HTML content (e.g. email clients), so HTML injections are also possible. Sometimes the sink can be scripting templates, XPath, LDAP, etc., so those would be equally impacted. So just like Web applications, Desktop apps are quite vulnerable to all common Injection attacks. If Desktop apps consume web API/microservices, so all relevant attacks of the web would also be applicable here.</p><h3></h3><h3>Exploitability Rational:</h3><p>Since desktop apps may be used under multiple situations, it might need an user to login or sometimes a guest user like a public kiosk.</p><h3></h3><h3>Impact:</h3><p>Based upon sink, either it may end up into a successful privileged command execution, unauthorized data access, entire system compromise or denial of service.</p><h3></h3><h3>Prevention:</h3><ul><li>One of the quite common practices is to sanitize user input, considering all input as suspicious.</li><li>Industrial Standard recommendation for SQL like usage of stored procedures / parameterized queries.</li><li>Avoiding user input getting into execution of system level commands.</li><li>Using forms of encoding based upon where it is going to be used, can prevent injections.</li></ul>",

Issues such as insecure authentication implementation, authentication bypass, improper session, etc. falls into this vulnerability category. An attacker can exploit insecure implementation in order to compromise user sessions, credentials and keys or to assume the identity of the user of the application. Taking example of desktop apps which are deployed to be used by public users e.g. ticketing kiosk / dispensers / tourist information kiosk etc., such systems might miss out implementing authentication properly or some emergency devices like in medical systems, where authentication is considered a little relaxed, if it comes at risk to patient life while performing a treatment or power plants, production line, law enforcement system apps etc..</p><h3></h3><h3>Exploitability Rational:</h3><p>Since a desktop may be used under multiple situations, it might need an attacker to login or sometimes a guest user like a public kiosk with physical access.</p><h3></h3><h3>Impact:</h3><p>It may end up in a successful unauthorized data access or entire system compromise.</p><h3></h3><h3>Prevention:</h3><ul><li>Industrial Standard recommendations like invalidating session upon inactivity, having short session life time, session entropy, etc. can prevent improper session management.</li><li>In the case of external Authentication hardware (like RFID/USB key etc.) is being used, accepting a dynamic user challenge code in the form of PIN/password as 2nd factor of Authentication.

It may also happen that desktop apps process any form of sensitive information like PII/Financial records/documents etc., but they do not have data encryption in place, this may lead unauthorized person to access such information in cleartext. Ideally drive level encryption and application layer encryption for data at rest is required. In case if the system which runs the desktop app is poorly configured, it may allow dumping memory of a process.
