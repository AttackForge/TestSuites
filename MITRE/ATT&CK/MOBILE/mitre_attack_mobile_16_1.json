For example, a malicious application may register itself as a VPN client, effectively redirecting device traffic to adversary-owned resources. Registering as a VPN client requires user consent on both Android and iOS; additionally, a special entitlement granted by Apple is needed for iOS devices. Alternatively, a malicious application with escalation privileges may utilize those privileges to gain access to network traffic.   </p><p>Specific to Android devices, adversary-in-the-disk is a type of AiTM attack where adversaries monitor and manipulate data that is exchanged between applications and external storage.(Citation: mitd<em>kaspersky)(Citation: mitd</em>checkpoint)(Citation: mitd<em>checkpoint</em>research) To accomplish this, a malicious application firsts requests for access to multimedia files on the device (<code class=\"inline-code-container\">READ_EXTERNAL STORAGE</code> and <code class=\"inline-code-container\">WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code>), then the application reads data on the device and/or writes malware to the device. Though the request for access is common, when used maliciously, adversaries may access files and other sensitive data due to abusing the permission. Multiple applications were shown to be vulnerable against this attack; however, scrutiny of permissions and input validations may mitigate this attack.    </p><p>Outside of a mobile device, adversaries may be able to capture traffic by employing a rogue base station or Wi-Fi access point. These devices will allow adversaries to capture network traffic after it has left the device, while it is flowing to its destination. On a local network, enterprise techniques could be used, such as <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/002\">ARP Cache Poisoning</a> or <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/003\">DHCP Spoofing</a>.  </p><p>If applications properly encrypt their network traffic, sensitive data may not be accessible to adversaries, depending on the point of capture. For example, properly implementing Apple’s Application Transport Security (ATS) and Android’s Network Security Configuration (NSC) may prevent sensitive data leaks.(Citation: NSC_Android)</p>",

Vulnerabilities can exist in software due to insecure coding practices that can lead to unanticipated behavior. Adversaries may take advantage of certain vulnerabilities through targeted exploitation for the purpose of arbitrary code execution. Oftentimes the most valuable exploits to an offensive toolkit are those that can be used to obtain code execution on a remote system because they can be used to gain access to that system. Users will expect to see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high utility. </p><p>Adversaries may use device-based zero-click exploits for code execution. These exploits are powerful because there is no user interaction required for code execution. </p><h3>SMS/iMessage Delivery</h3><p>SMS and iMessage in iOS are common targets through <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1456\">Drive-By Compromise</a>, <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1660\">Phishing</a>, etc. Adversaries may use embed malicious links, files, etc. in SMS messages or iMessages. Mobile devices may be compromised through one-click exploits, where the victim must interact with a text message, or zero-click exploits, where no user interaction is required. </p><h3>AirDrop</h3><p>Unique to iOS, AirDrop is a network protocol that allows iOS users to transfer files between iOS devices. Before patches from Apple were released, on iOS 13.4 and earlier, adversaries may force the Apple Wireless Direct Link (AWDL) interface to activate, then exploit a buffer overflow to gain access to the device and run as root without interaction from the user.  </p>",

Similar to  other <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1627/001\">Geofencing</a> methods, this requires that the user has granted the <code class=\"inline-code-container\">ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</code> and <code class=\"inline-code-container\">ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION</code> permissions. The latter is only required if the application targets Android 10 (API level 29) or higher. However, Android 11 introduced additional permission controls that may restrict background location collection based on user permission choices at runtime. These additional controls include \"Allow only while using the app\", which will effectively prohibit background location collection.  </p><p>Similarly, on iOS, developers can use built-in APIs to setup and execute geofencing. Depending on the use case, the app will either need to call <code class=\"inline-code-container\">requestWhenInUseAuthorization()</code> or <code class=\"inline-code-container\">requestAlwaysAuthorization()</code>, depending on when access to the location services is required. Similar to Android, users also have the option to limit when the application can access the device’s location, including one-time use and only when the application is running in the foreground.  </p><p><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1627/001\">Geofencing</a> can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within. For example, location data could be used to limit malware spread and/or capabilities, which could also potentially evade application analysis environments (ex: malware analysis outside of the target geographic area).
